        Programmable Logic (PL) bitstreams implementing PHiLICS applications.
		
		This package allows a user to select the PL bitstream which is to be
		loaded to the PL fabric by the FSBL on boot. The selected bitstream
		will be included in the boot.bin file produced by the post-image.sh 
		script provided by the QUT external tree (br-external/board/cosmos).
